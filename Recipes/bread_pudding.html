<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In my opinion, there is nothing like a fresh, warm bread pudding to finish off a meal. With simple prep, and not many ingredients, it is a stellar option to cap off a meal.</p>
    <p>Not to mention, bread pudding can help use up leftover ingredients, and is a great way to conserve leftover items laying around post-meal.</p>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (1/4 stick) unsalted butter, more for greasing pan</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>⅓ cup sugar</li>
        <li>Pinch salt</li>
        <li>½ loaf sweet egg bread like challah or brioche, cut into 2-inch cubes (about 5 to 6 cups)</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
    </ul>

<h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 350 degrees. In a small saucepan over low heat, warm milk, butter, vanilla, sugar and salt. Continue cooking just until butter melts; cool. Meanwhile, butter a 4-to-6-cup baking dish and fill it with cubed bread.</li>
        <li>Add eggs to cooled milk mixture and whisk; pour mixture over bread. Bake for 30 to 45 minutes, or until custard is set but still a little wobbly and edges of bread have browned. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
